# perp-state — Hydra in-head benchmark @ 200 TPS [auto-generated]

> PlutusV3 perp_state script-spend (no-op MatchedOrders, seq bump) — the original r1-spike workload.

**Date:** 2026-07-27T07:09:47.091Z

**Decision:** **GATE FAIL** — gated on **txvalid** steady P95 = 23376.940500000004ms vs gate ≤ 200ms.

## What was measured

6000 pre-signed txs were fired round-robin across 40 independent lanes at a sustained 200 TPS (open-loop). Signing is off the hot path, so the rig genuinely *offers* the target rate — any remaining ceiling is the node's. Two latencies are correlated per tx: **TxValid** (node validated the state transition locally) and **SnapshotConfirmed** (settled in a signed snapshot).

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| Target TPS | 200 |
| Loop mode | open-loop |
| Lanes × chain | 40 × 150 = 6000 |
| Offered (submit) | 6000 @ 222.4 TPS |
| Node-validated (TxValid) | 4398 @ 163.1 TPS |
| TxInvalid (logic reject — **gated**) | 0 |
| Stale-input race (rig timing — **excluded from gate**) | 0 |
| Confirmed (in snapshot) | 689 @ 25.5 TPS |
| Snapshots observed | 11 |
| Avg tx / snapshot | 62.6 |
| **TxValid latency (matching) — steady P50/P95/P99/max** | **15588.491334000002 / 23376.940500000004 / 23773.966083 / 23866.444750000002 ms** (n=3214/4398) |
| SnapshotConfirmed latency (settlement) — steady P50/P95/P99/max | 13958.938416 / 36756.175792 / 36878.754542 / 36905.363375 ms (n=689/689) |
| Saturated? | true |
| node-vs-client verdict | both-continuous |

Two metrics, two purposes. **TxValid** = node applied the state transition (the right latency for *matching* feasibility). **SnapshotConfirmed** = settled in a multi-party-signed snapshot (the only state safe to fan out / withdraw against). Hydra **batches** snapshots on a cadence, so per-tx SnapshotConfirmed P95 ≤ 200ms is *not* an achievable target and must NOT gate matching; it is tracked as a separate settlement-cadence signal. Where the throughputs diverge locates any ceiling: offered ≈ 200 but validated ≪ 200 ⇒ node validation is the limit; validated ≈ offered but confirm lags ⇒ snapshot cadence (settlement), not matching.

> ⚠️ TxValid is **not** finality. On head close/contestation only the latest *confirmed snapshot* survives on L1; a TxValid-but-not-yet-snapshotted tx can be lost. Custody/withdraw/fanout MUST wait for SnapshotConfirmed.

## Gate decision

❌ **FAIL** — txvalid steady P95 23376.940500000004ms > 200ms / node saturated (validated ≪ offered). Locate the ceiling via offered-vs-validated above.
